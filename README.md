# ntlmCracker
ntlm hash cracker

This python script is designed to make requests by either file input or stdin to ntlm.pw
It has the option of threads but please don't get crazy with it because we don't want to overload the server and ruin a good thing!

Special thank you to the creator/s and contributors of ntlm.pw! 

Installation instructions not required for this one. If you don't know, maybe you shouldn't be using this script...

`./ntlmCracker --help ` for usage


You get to make 1000 request every 15 minutes so my suggestion is to prioritise your most important hashes to the top of the list.
